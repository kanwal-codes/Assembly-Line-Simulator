In this assignment, I implemented a modular system to simulate an assembly line, focusing on efficient parsing, data handling, and dynamic resource management. The Utilities module handled input parsing with robust exception handling, while the Station module managed station-specific details like inventory and serial numbers, ensuring consistent formatting. The CustomerOrder module managed dynamically allocated resources for order processing, with careful attention to memory management using constructors and destructors. The Workstation extended station functionality by managing order queues, and the LineManager coordinated the assembly line flow using STL algorithms for efficiency. Challenges included managing dynamic memory and ensuring seamless integration across modules, which deepened my understanding of resource management and STL usage. The implementation was validated against the provided testers, ensuring functionality and compliance with assignment requirements.
